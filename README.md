## Lab Question Answers

Question 1: Under what circumstances do you think it will be worthwhile to offload one or both
of the processing tasks to your PC? And conversely, under what circumstances will it not be
worthwhile?

Answer: If the processes are intensive and the rpi can't handle the workload, it may be worthwhile to offload one or both of the tasks to the PC, which can handle more and reduce rpi processing. On the other hand, if the processes aren't intensive and the rpi can handle the workload, it may not be worthwhile as it'll introduce latency and overhead.
